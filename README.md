# Module-1-Accessibility-Challenge

## Description

 This project was meant to be a way to learn how to use semantic HTML elements, along with simplifying and cleaning up code. I learned plenty of things, but most importantly I figured out I could put other elements inside already established CSS elements. Alongside this, I also became less scared of turning divs into more semantic elements.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

The website itself explains the many uses and benefits to having a website for your business. 
As for functions within the website itself:
The main page has links within the header that guide the reader to the sections they're seeking out.
![Main](assets/images/Horiseon%20Main.png)
And with a click, they will go to one of the three respective sections; labeled as such by the header.
![Sections](assets/images/Horiseon%20Sections.png)
