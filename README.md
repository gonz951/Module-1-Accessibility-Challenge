# Module-1-Accessibility-Challenge

## Description

 This project was meant to be a way to learn how to use semantic HTML elements, along with simplifying and cleaning up code. I learned plenty of things, but most importantly I figured out I could put other elements inside already established CSS elements. Alongside this, I also became less scared of turning divs into more semantic elements.

## Installation

## Usage

The website itself explains the many uses and benefits to having a website for your business. 

As for functions within the website itself:
The main page has links within the header that guide the reader to the sections they're seeking out.

And with a click, they will go to one of the three respective sections; labeled as such by the header.
