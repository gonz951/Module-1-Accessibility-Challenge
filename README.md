# Module-1-Accessibility-Challenge

## Description

 This project was meant to be a way to learn how to use semantic HTML elements, along with simplifying and cleaning up code. I learned plenty of things, but most importantly I figured out I could put other elements inside already established CSS elements. Alongside this, I also became less scared of turning divs into more semantic elements.

## Installation

## Usage

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
